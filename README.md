# Password Generator Mountan

## Description

 The motivation behind this project was to use what we learned about javascript in week 3 and apply it to a website that randomly generates a password and ultimately reinforce what was taught to us. This project was built because I wanted to apply what I know about javascript to a useful website. The code was provided but we had to add to it in order for it to function correctly and in the end, I was able to get it functioning. I learned a lot about javascript in general but more specifically, how to split arrays and then join them back together.
